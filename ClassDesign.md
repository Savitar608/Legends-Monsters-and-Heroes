# Class Design Document

## 1. Overview
This document describes the class structure and relationships for the "Legends: Monsters and Heroes" game. The project follows an object-oriented design with a clear separation of concerns between the game logic, data models, and input/output handling.

## 2. Package Structure
The source code is organized into the following packages:
- `com.legends`: Contains the main entry point.
- `com.legends.game`: Contains the core game logic, board management, and battle system.
- `com.legends.model`: Contains the data models for entities (heroes, monsters), items, and the party.
- `com.legends.io`: Contains interfaces and implementations for user input and output.
- `com.legends.utils`: Contains utility classes for data loading.
